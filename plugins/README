The plugins/ directory used to be the single source for where my plugins
live. However, I have since changed to relying on the package manager ELPA to
handle the majority of my packages. ELPA doesn't have everything, however, so
this folder remains a place to put custom scripts and small patches that aren't
uploaded to MELPA or other repositories.
